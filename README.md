# Description
This package contains several functions for preprocessing and evaluating machine learning models, including:

1. preprocess_data(): Preprocesses the input data by handling missing values, binarizing continuous variables, scaling the data, and balancing the target values.

2. train_model(): Trains a machine learning model using hyperparameter tuning, if desired.

3. compare_models(): Compares the performance of multiple models using cross-validation.

4. predict(): Makes predictions using a trained model.

5. evaluate_model(): Evaluates the performance of a model using a variety of evaluation metrics.

## Usage
To use this package, import the necessary functions and call them as follows:


1. Preprocess the input data
X_preprocessed, y_balanced = dataprocessing.preprocess_data(X, y)

2. Train a model using hyperparameter tuning
best_model = dataprocessing.train_model(X, y, hyperparameters=param_grid)

3. Compare the performance of multiple models
scores = dataprocessing.compare_models(models, X, y)

4. Make predictions using a trained model
y_pred = dataprocessing.predict(best_model, X_test)

5. Evaluate the performance of a model
scores = dataprocessing.evaluate_model(best_model, X_test, y_test)
